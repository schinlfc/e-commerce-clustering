### 1. Problem statement
A UK-based online retail store has captured the sales data for different products for the period of one year (Nov 2016 to Dec 2017). The organization sells gifts primarily on the online platform. The customers who make a purchase consume directly for themselves. There are small businesses that buy in bulk and sell to other customers through the retail outlet channel.

### 2. Project objective
This project aims to find significant customers for the business who make high purchases of their favourite products. The organization wants to roll out a loyalty program to the high-value customers after identification of segments. I use the clustering methodology to segment customers into groups.

### 3. Data and methodology
#### 3.1 Data
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## Required R libraries
load_libraries <- function(){
  library(usdm)
  library(sp)
  library(raster)
  library(dplyr)
  library(ggplot2)
  library(cluster)
  library(purrr)
  library(tidyverse)
  library(factoextra)
  library(DataExplorer)
  library(gridExtra)
  library(lubridate)
print("The libraries are loaded.")
}
load_libraries()

## Set working directory
setwd("/Users/schinlfc/data-science-R/e-commerce-clustering/data")

## Load dataset
ecommerce <- read.csv("Ecommerce.csv")

## Data preprocessing
# View the structure of the data frame
str(ecommerce)
# View basic summary statistics
summary(ecommerce)
# View number of rows and columns
dim(ecommerce)
# Find the number of missing values in the rows and columns
namat <- is.na(ecommerce)
table(rowSums(namat))
# Find the total number of missing values in each column
colSums(namat)
# The alternative way to find the the number of missing values in each column
naecommerce <- ecommerce %>% mutate_all(is.na)
print(naecommerce %>% summarise_all(sum))
# Remove column 'X' since the entire column fill with NA
ecommerce <- ecommerce[, -9]
# Remove missing rows for column 'CustomerID' 
ecommerce <- na.omit(ecommerce)
# View number of rows after removing NA's
nrow(ecommerce)
# Convert column 'InvoiceDate' to appropriate date class
ecommerce <- ecommerce %>% mutate(InvoiceDate = lubridate::dmy(InvoiceDate))
head(ecommerce, 10)
```
